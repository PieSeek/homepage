          There are a lot of reasons to choose Debian as your operating system - as a user,
          as a developer, and even in enterprise environments. Most users appreciate the
          stability, and the smooth upgrade processes of both packages and the entire distribution.
          Debian is also widely used by software and hardware developers because it runs on numerous
          architectures and devices, offers a public bug tracker and other tools for developers. If 
          you plan to use Debian in a professional environment, there are additional benefits like 
          LTS versions and cloud images.

          The Fedora Project is a community of people working together to build a free and open source 
          software platform and to collaborate on and share user-focused solutions built on that platform. 
          Or, in plain English, we make an operating system, and we make it easy for you to do useful stuff with it.
